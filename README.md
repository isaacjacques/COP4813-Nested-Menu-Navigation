# Assignment 4: Nested Menu Navigation Webpage

## Introduction
In this assignment, students will design and implement a multi‐page website with a nested menu structure. The homepage will display three subjects. Clicking on any subject will reveal four related topics. Clicking on a topic will navigate to a dedicated topic page. A “Back” button on each topic page will return the user to the homepage showing only the three top-level subjects. Students will deploy the project to a public web hosting service and document their implementation.

## Objectives
- Build a responsive HTML website with nested navigation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Create and link multiple topic pages.
- Implement a “Back” functionality that returns the user to the homepage.
- Deploy the website using a free hosting platform.
- Document the site structure and navigation logic.

## System Requirements

### 3.1 Technologies to be Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**  
- **Free hosting provider**: GitHub Pages, 000WebHost, InfinityFree, or equivalent

## Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Webpage Structure

#### Homepage (`index.html`)
- Displays three subjects of your choice (e.g., “Mathematics”, “Science”, “History”)
- Each subject is clickable
- Clicking a subject reveals four topics underneath (e.g., “Algebra”, “Geometry”, etc.)

#### Topic Pages
- Clicking on a topic takes the user to a new HTML page with relevant content (you may include a heading, a paragraph, and an image or video)
- Each topic page must include a “Back” button that links back to the homepage, resetting the view to only the three top-level subjects

### 4.2 Navigation Behavior
- Use JavaScript or CSS for show/hide behavior on the homepage
- Use individual HTML pages for each topic
- The navigation must be intuitive and work on both desktop and mobile

### 4.3 Deployment
- Deploy the website using a free hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages, 000WebHost, InfinityFree)
- Ensure the site is publicly accessible from any browser

### 4.4 Output
- A working, navigable website with:
  - A homepage with nested menus
  - 12 topic pages (4 topics × 3 subjects)
  - Working “Back” buttons on all topic pages
- A public URL where the site is deployed

## Deployment Instructions
1. Choose a hosting provider and deploy your entire website structure.  
2. Test all subject/topic links and “Back” buttons.  
3. Verify that the layout works correctly on both desktop and mobile.
